## Introduction

Updated's codebase is set up in a monorepo via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and is fully [open-source on GitHub](https://git.new/midday).

Here's the monorepo structure:

```
apps
├── api
├── dashboard
├── docs
├── engine
├── mobile
├── website
packages
├── documents
├── email
├── events
├── import
├── inbox
├── jobs
├── kv
├── location
├── notification
├── supabase
├── tsconfig
├── ui
├── utils
```

The `apps` directory contains the code for:

- `api`: The backend for Updated (supabase).
- `dashboard`: Updated's application ([app.midday.ai](https://app.midday.ai)).
- `docs`: Updated's documentation site ([midday.ai/docs](https://midday.ai/docs)).
- `engine`: Updated's bank engine ([midday.ai/engine](https://midday.ai/engine)).
- `mobile`: Updated's mobile app.
- `website`: Updated's website app ([midday.ai](https://midday.ai)).

The `packages` directory contains the code for:

- `documents`: OCR for receipts.
- `events`: Analytics library.
- `import`: CSV-importer.
- `inbox`: Inbox utils.
- `jobs`: Background jobs.
- `kv`: Key value storage client.
- `location`: Location related utils.
- `notification`: Notifications client.
- `supabase`: Queries and client.
- `tsconfig`: The TypeScript configuration for Updated's web app.
- `ui`: UI component library.
- `utils`: A collection of utility functions and constants used across Updated's codebase.
